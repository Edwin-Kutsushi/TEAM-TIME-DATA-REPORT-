# TEAM-TIME-DATA-REPORT-
These is week five report to be submitted before the completion of the Data Science Prep Course. The group has five members who worked with lots of efforts to ensure the project is completed on time.
The project tittle is:
Unbiased distribution of disability devices

Problem statement
People living with disabilities are spread out across the 47 counties in Kenya. They often need devices to perform a number of activities in their day-to-day lives. 
Currently, the government has put measures in place through the National Council for Persons with Disabilities (NCPWD); to ensure that people living with various disabilities have access to devices that will act as enablers in them achieving tasks.
The NCPWD seeks to maximize distribution of disability devices across the 47 counties to ensure that every person living with a disability receives the necessary device. To achieve this, they have requested for the services of our Data Science team to conduct research and provide recommendations on the strategy to distribute disability devices.

Source of data
The data has been sourced from: Kenya Open Data – Health category
Distribution Of Assistive Devices And Services By National Council For Persons With Disabilities; https://www.opendata.go.ke/datasets/distribution-of-assistive-devices-and-services-by-national-council-for-persons-with-disabilities-ncpwd

How we will tackle the problem
We will perform analysis to achieve the following:
●	Identify the number of devices per category.
●	Distribution of devices per county and checking the percentage of the counties that do not have the specific devices, given that the number of counties in Kenya is 47.
●	Identification of the disabilities that have been given more focus than others.
●	Identification of highly priced devices and recommendation on how the costs can be distributed effectively to acquire more affordable devices.

Tools that we are going to use
●	Jira
●	Github
●	Jupyter Notebook - Google Collaboratory
